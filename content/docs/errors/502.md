**502 (Bad Gateway) errors** indicate that our servers responded incorrectly to a request. Most of the time, this error is transitory and a simple refresh will solve the issue. Sometimes though, the error may persist for a few minutes, usually indicating a software issue such as PHP being unavailable.

When this happens, our servers usually recover within a few minutes. Most of the times though, refreshing the page in that instant will fix the issue.

# What can I do?
Try refreshing the page, that typically fixes the issue. If that doesn't help, try again in a few minutes.

If the issue persists for more than a few minutes though, please <a href="https://wikiforge.github.io/contact-us">contact us</a>.
